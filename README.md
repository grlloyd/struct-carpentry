# Introduction to Untargeted Metabolomics Data Analaysis in R using struct and structToolbox packages

This lesson introduces the use of [struct][struct] and [structToolbox][structToolbox] packages to analyse untagargeted LCMS metabolomics data sets. It is primarily intended as required pre-course training material for attendees of the Birmingham Metabolomics Training Centre ([BMTC][bmtc]), but can also be used as a standalone lesson. The lesson includes:

- Instructions on how to get started
- An introduction to the R-package `struct` and its templates
- Downloading data from [Metabolomics Workbench][workbench] using R-package [metabolomicsWorkBenchR][workbenchr]
- Building simple data processing workflows using the pre-built templates in `structToolbox`
